Good morning [ladies and] gentleman. My name is Mr. McElwee, I will be your instructor for the next several months as we learn how to code. Before we get started, I know none of you. So I'd like to go around the room and have everyone give me your name and your favorite book. 

## Icebreaker

> Go around the room give me your **name** and your favorite **book**.

## Rules/Syllabus

### Classroom Rules
- Ask questions
- Interrupt me
- Computers are for code, not for notes

## Lesson

> Check to ensure that everyone has their machines set up

If you do not have your machine set up do not worry, we'll take some time after I explain the assignment to make sure you are ready to go. I prepped this a little short just in case that happened. I get there were a lot of moving pieces on this one.
