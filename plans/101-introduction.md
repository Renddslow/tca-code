Good morning [ladies and] gentleman. My name is Mr. McElwee, I will be your instructor for the next several months as we learn how to code. Before we get started, I know none of you. So I'd like to go around the room and have everyone give me your name and your favorite book. 

## Icebreaker

> Go around the room give me your **name** and your favorite **book**.

## Rules/Syllabus

### Classroom Rules
- Ask questions
- Interrupt me
- Computers are for code, not for notes

## Lesson

> Check to ensure that everyone has their machines set up

If you do not have your machine set up do not worry, we'll take some time after I explain the assignment to make sure you are ready to go. I prepped this a little short just in case that happened. I get there were a lot of moving pieces on this one.

[Student Handout]()

One of the things I want to be super clear about is that this class is largely for you. I want you guys to learn how to program and really get something useful out of this class. To make sure that we're all on the same page, I want to hear what made you want to learn more about coding? What are you hoping to do at the end of this that you cannot do now?

Code can be used for tons of stuff, some of them good, some of the neutral, and some of them bad. Code is used to power our streets at night, its used for search and rescue operations, its used to create self-driving vehicles. Its also used to make computer viruses that tear everything down. But more and more its an integral part of our society.

What's cool is that once you have the basics down, the "grammar" if you will, it's really easy to build upon. There are coders who've been at this since before I've been alive and they're still learning and growing. But what's nice is, it doesn't have to take years and years to get started.

> At the end of the day, code is a way for a person to talk to a machine.

So when it comes to coding, there are tons of different ways to talk to the machine and tell it to do stuff. You might want to tell a machine to serve up a web site, or maybe you want it to play a video, or start up a video game, or turn on a light. All of that is done deep down in the machine through a bunch of tiny little transistors, basically little doors that either have electricity flowing through them or they don't. This is where the 1's a 0's come from. But obviously we don't want to talk to a computer through 1's and 0's, we want to talk to it in a way that we can easily read and write.

The way we do that is through programming languages. A programming language is a way for us to write a bunch of words and keywords that are familiar to us. It's a way for us to logically arrange instructions that computer can understand but we can also understand. 

For this class we're going to use a programming language called Python. Python is a language that was designed to be really really easy for people to read and understand, while also being able to be pretty fast for a machine to understand as well. Over the course of the next few weeks we're going to spend time learning terms and applying them. We're going to do our best to apply them by actually writing code. In fact we will even be writing a smidge of code this week.

So by the time you go on Christmas vacation I expect that along with having built a game you will have a foundational understanding of the following:

- Variables
- Conditions
- Functions
- Loops
- Lists
- Dictionaries

The are the building blocks of every piece of code that is running in the wild.
