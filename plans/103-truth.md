Good morning everyone. Once again I am Mr. McElwee and once again my pronunciation guide is on the board.

## Introduction

Role call
- Favorite fairy tale or myth

### Classroom Rules
- Ask questions
- Interrupt me
- Computers are for code, not for notes

### Review Last Week

- Exercises
    - Any questions?
    - Problems with Exercise 3 (`str` solution)
    - The COUNT (review files that have variables)

## Lesson

0. Review data types introduced last week
1. Boolean
    > A data type that has one of two possible values (true or false) and is meant to represent the truth values
    1. Booleans in Python
    2. Why Booleans are important in programming
2. Truth
    1. Truthiness vs. Falsiness
    2. Booleans represent one of those two states
3. Equality
    1. What an equality check is
    2. Equality checks in Python (ex. 1)
    3. Data-type equality (ex. 2)
4. Conjunctions
    1. What a conjunction is (Venn Diagram)
    2. Conjunctions in Python (ex. 3)
5. Disjunctions
    1. What a disjunction is (Venn Diagram)
    2. Disjunctions in Python (ex. 4)
6. Compound logic statements (ex. 5)
7. Order of operations (PEMDAS)
    1. Left side resolves just like math
    2. Right side resolves just like math
    3. Checks types
8. Explain take-home
