## Basic Course Information
Over the course of this semester we will tackle the fundamentals of programming and thinking logically using the Python programming language. Each week we will conclude with a simple take home project which will reinforce what we learned in class with the end goal for the semester being building our own text-based adventure game.

## About Me

## Course Goals

## Course Materials and Requirements
- A laptop/portable computer with Internet access.
- A local development environment (see the [setup guide](https://gist.github.com/Renddslow/3ee1cf06d210c82a808fc54baaf11225) for everything you need to get up and running)
- A Bitbucket account. You should receive an email invite from me prior to your first day of class. Please come with this set up.


## Grading and Assessment
In the software world it is very rare that you find yourself in the position where you work is "graded." In most, if not all, environments, your work will be reviewed by a number of peers and perhaps tested before being approved and deployed to the end-user.
In this class we will take the same approach. Each assignment will be reviewed and will be considered "done" when it is "ready for production." As such, the only way to fail an assignment is to not participate.
